"Many third-party distributors are now providing versions of Django "
"integrated with their package-management systems. These can make "
"installation and upgrading much easier for users of Django since the "
"integration includes the ability to automatically install dependencies (like "
"database adapters) that Django requires."

"Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of Django, "
"so if you want to use the development version of Django you'll need to "
"follow the instructions for :ref:`installing the development version "

"If you're using Linux or a Unix installation, such as OpenSolaris, check "
"with your distributor to see if they already package Django. If you're using "
"a Linux distro and don't know how to find out if a package is available, "
"then now is a good time to learn.  The Django Wiki contains a list of `Third "
"Party Distributions`_ to help you out."
