"Django's migration system is split into two parts; the logic for calculating "
"and storing what operations should be run (``django.db.migrations``), and "
"the database abstraction layer that turns things like \"create a model\" or "
"\"delete a field\" into SQL - which is the job of the ``SchemaEditor``."

"If you are writing or maintaining a third-party database backend for Django, "
"you will need to provide a ``SchemaEditor`` implementation in order to work "
"with 1.7's migration functionality - however, as long as your database is "
"relatively standard in its use of SQL and relational design, you should be "
"able to subclass one of the built-in Django ``SchemaEditor`` classes and "
"just tweak the syntax a little. Also note that there are a few new database "
"features that migrations will look for: ``can_rollback_ddl`` and "
"``supports_combined_alters`` are the most important."
