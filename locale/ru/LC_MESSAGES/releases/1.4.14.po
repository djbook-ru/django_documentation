"Before this release, Django's file upload handing in its default "
"configuration may degrade to producing a huge number of ``os.stat()`` system "
"calls when a duplicate filename is uploaded. Since ``stat()`` may invoke IO, "
"this may produce a huge data-dependent slowdown that slowly worsens over "
"time. The net result is that given enough time, a user with the ability to "
"upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler, eventually "
"causing it to become very slow simply by uploading 0-byte files. At this "
"point, even a slow network connection and few HTTP requests would be all "
"that is necessary to make a site unavailable."

"In older versions of Django it was possible to reveal any field's data by "
"modifying the \"popup\" and \"to_field\" parameters of the query string on "
"an admin change form page. For example, requesting a URL like ``/admin/auth/"
"user/?pop=1&t=password`` and viewing the page's HTML allowed viewing the "
"password hash of each user. While the admin requires users to have "
"permissions to view the change form pages in the first place, this could "
"leak data if you rely on users having access to view only certain fields on "
"a model."
